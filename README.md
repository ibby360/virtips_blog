## Inspiration

This project is based on the goal of improving my skills as a Self-taught enthusiast and the best way to improve is by building projects. I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of Django and Object-oriented programming in Python. I have learnt different technologies for the project and I keep on learning new skills as I add new features to the project.
